# README
# Hello everyone, in here I (Kaenova | Bangkit Mentor ML-20) 
# will give you some headstart on createing ML API. 
# Please read every lines and comments carefully. 
# 
# I give you a headstart on text based input and image based input API. 
# To run this server, don't forget to install all the libraries in the
# requirements.txt simply by "pip install -r requirements.txt" 
# and then use "python main.py" to run it
# 
# For ML:
# Please prepare your model either in .h5 or saved model format.
# Put your model in the same folder as this main.py file.
# You will load your model down the line into this code. 
# There are 2 option I give you, either your model image based input 
# or text based input. You need to finish functions "def predict_text" or "def predict_image"
# 
# For CC:
# You can check the endpoint that ML being used, eiter it's /predict_text or 
# /predict_image. For /predict_text you need a JSON {"text": "your text"},
# and for /predict_image you need to send an multipart-form with a "uploaded_file" 
# field. you can see this api documentation when running this server and go into /docs
# I also prepared the Dockerfile so you can easily modify and create a container iamge
# The default port is 8080, but you can inject PORT environement variable.
# 
# If you want to have consultation with me
# just chat me through Discord (kaenova#2859) and arrange the consultation time
#
# Share your capstone application with me! 🥳
